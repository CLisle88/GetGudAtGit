This is a placeholder for a screenshot of the application.

To add a screenshot:
1. Take a screenshot of your GetGud@Git application in action
2. Save it as "screenshot.png" in the root directory
3. Replace this text file with the PNG image

A good screenshot would show:
- The editor with some code
- The branch visualization
- The tutorial panel
- The terminal with some Git commands

This will help make your GitHub repository more appealing and informative to potential users.
